(* Exercise: 2 stars, advanced (subsequence)

A list is a subsequence of another list if all of the elements in the first list
occur in the same order in the second list, possibly with some extra elements in
between. For example,

      [1;2;3]

is a subsequence of each of the lists

      [1;2;3]
      [1;1;1;2;2;3]
      [1;2;7;3]
      [5;6;1;9;9;2;7;3;8]

but it is not a subsequence of any of the lists

      [1;2]
      [1;3]
      [5;6;2;1;7;3;8].

Define an inductive proposition subseq on list nat that captures what it means to be
a subsequence. (Hint: You'll need three cases.)
Prove subseq_refl that subsequence is reflexive, that is, any list is a subsequence of itself.
Prove subseq_app that for any lists l1, l2, and l3, if l1 is a subsequence of l2, then l1 
is also a subsequence of l2 ++ l3.
(Optional, harder) Prove subseq_trans that subsequence is transitive -- that is, if l1 is 
a subsequence of l2 and l2 is a subsequence of l3, then l1 is a subsequence of l3. Hint: choose
your induction carefully!

(* Exercise: 5 stars, advanced (weak_pumping)

One of the first really interesting theorems in the theory of regular expressions 
is the so-called pumping lemma, which states, informally, that any sufficiently 
long string s matching a regular expression re can be "pumped" by repeating some 
middle section of s an arbitrary number of times to produce a new string also matching
re. (For the sake of simplicity in this exercise, we consider a slightly weaker theorem 
than is usually stated in courses on automata theory.)

To get started, we need to define "sufficiently long." Since we are working in a constructive
logic, we actually need to be able to calculate, for each regular expression re, the minimum 
length for strings s to guarantee "pumpability." *)

(* The (weak) pumping lemma itself says that, if s =~ re and if the length of s is at least the 
pumping constant of re, then s can be split into three substrings s1 ++ s2 ++ s3 in such a way 
that s2 can be repeated any number of times and the result, when combined with s1 and s3 will 
still match re. Since s2 is also guaranteed not to be the empty string, this gives us a 
(constructive!) way to generate strings matching re that are as long as we like. *)

(* We've seen in the Logic chapter that we often need to relate boolean computations to statements
 in Prop. But performing this conversion as we did it there can result in tedious proof scripts.

        + (* n =? m = false *)

Qed.

(* In the first branch after destruct, we explicitly apply the eqb_eq lemma to the equation
generated by destructing n =? m, to convert the assumption n =? m = true into the assumption n = m;
then we had to rewrite using this assumption to complete the case.

We can streamline this by defining an inductive proposition that yields a better case-analysis 
principle for n =? m. Instead of generating an equation such as (n =? m) = true, which is generally
not directly useful, this principle gives us right away the assumption we really need: n = m.

Following the terminology introduced in Logic, we call this the "reflection principle for equality
(between numbers)," and we say that the boolean n =? m is reflected in the proposition n = m. *)

Inductive reflect (P : Prop) : bool -> Prop :=
  | ReflectT (H : P) : reflect P true
  | ReflectF (H : ~ P) : reflect P false.

(* The reflect property takes two arguments: a proposition P and a boolean b. Intuitively, it states
that the property P is reflected in (i.e., equivalent to) the boolean b: that is, P holds if and only
if b = true. To see this, notice that, by definition, the only way we can produce evidence for reflect
P true is by showing P and then using the ReflectT constructor. If we invert this statement, this means
that it should be possible to extract evidence for P from a proof of reflect P true. Similarly, the only
way to show reflect P false is by combining evidence for Â¬ P with the ReflectF constructor.

To put this observation to work, we first prove that the statements P â†” b = true and reflect P b are 
indeed equivalent. First, the left-to-right implication: *)

Theorem iff_reflect : forall P b, (P <-> b = true) -> reflect P b.
Proof.

(* The advantage of reflect over the normal "if and only if" connective is that, by destructing a
hypothesis or lemma of the form reflect P b, we can perform case analysis on b while at the same
time generating appropriate hypothesis in the two branches (P in the first subgoal and Â¬ P in the
second). *)

(* A smoother proof of filter_not_empty_In now goes as follows. Notice how the calls to destruct

differences in proof state at the beginning of the first case of the destruct.) *)

(* This small example shows reflection giving us a small gain in convenience; in larger developments,
using reflect consistently can often lead to noticeably shorter and clearer proof scripts. We'll see
many more examples in later chapters and in Programming Language Foundations.

The use of the reflect property has been popularized by SSReflect, a Coq library that has been used to
formalize important results in mathematics, including as the 4-color theorem and the Feit-Thompson
theorem. The name SSReflect stands for small-scale reflection, i.e., the pervasive use of reflection
to simplify small proof steps with boolean computations. *)

Formulating inductive definitions of properties is an important skill you'll need in this course. Try
to solve this exercise without any help at all.

We say that a list "stutters" if it repeats the same element consecutively. (This is different from
not containing duplicates: the sequence [1;4;1] repeats the element 1 but does not stutter.) The
property "nostutter mylist" means that mylist does not stutter. Formulate an inductive definition
for nostutter. *)

if the given one doesn't work for you. Your definition might be different from ours and still be

proofs use a number of tactics we haven't talked about, to make them more robust to different possible
ways of defining nostutter. You can probably just uncomment and use them as-is, but you can also prove

(* Exercise: 4 stars, advanced (filter_challenge)

Let's prove that our definition of filter from the Poly chapter matches an abstract specification.
Here is the specification, written out informally in English:

A list l is an "in-order merge" of l1 and l2 if it contains all the same elements as l1 and l2, in
the same order as l1 and l2, but possibly interleaved. For example,

    [1;4;6;2;3]

is an in-order merge of

    [1;6;2]

and

    [4;3].

Now, suppose we have a set X, a function test: Xâ†’bool, and a list l of type list X. Suppose further
that l is an in-order merge of two lists, l1 and l2, such that every item in l1 satisfies test and no
item in l2 satisfies test. Then filter test l = l1.

Translate this specification into a Coq theorem and prove it. (You'll need to begin by defining what 
it means for one list to be a merge of two others. Do this with an inductive relation, not a Fixpoint.) *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Extended Exercise: A Verified Regular-Expression Matcher *)

(** We have now defined a match relation over regular expressions and
    polymorphic lists. We can use such a definition to manually prove that
    a given regex matches a given string, but it does not give us a
    program that we can run to determine a match automatically.

    It would be reasonable to hope that we can translate the definitions
    of the inductive rules for constructing evidence of the match relation
    into cases of a recursive function that reflects the relation by recursing
    on a given regex. However, it does not seem straightforward to define
    such a function in which the given regex is a recursion variable
    recognized by Coq. As a result, Coq will not accept that the function
    always terminates.

    Heavily-optimized regex matchers match a regex by translating a given
    regex into a state machine and determining if the state machine
    accepts a given string. However, regex matching can also be
    implemented using an algorithm that operates purely on strings and
    regexes without defining and maintaining additional datatypes, such as
    state machines. We'll implement such an algorithm, and verify that
    its value reflects the match relation. *)

(** We will implement a regex matcher that matches strings represented
    as lists of ASCII characters: *)
Require Import Coq.Strings.Ascii.

Definition string := list ascii.

(** The Coq standard library contains a distinct inductive definition
    of strings of ASCII characters. However, we will use the above
    definition of strings as lists as ASCII characters in order to apply
    the existing definition of the match relation.

    We could also define a regex matcher over polymorphic lists, not lists
    of ASCII characters specifically. The matching algorithm that we will
    implement needs to be able to test equality of elements in a given
    list, and thus needs to be given an equality-testing
    function. Generalizing the definitions, theorems, and proofs that we
    define for such a setting is a bit tedious, but workable. *)

(** The proof of correctness of the regex matcher will combine
    properties of the regex-matching function with properties of the
    [match] relation that do not depend on the matching function. We'll go
    ahead and prove the latter class of properties now. Most of them have
    straightforward proofs, which have been given to you, although there

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, standard, optional (derive_corr)

    Prove that [derive] in fact always derives strings.

    Hint: one proof performs induction on [re], although you'll need
    to carefully choose the property that you prove by induction by
    generalizing the appropriate terms.

    Hint: if your definition of [derive] applies [match_eps] to a
    particular regex [re], then a natural proof will apply
    [match_eps_refl] to [re] and destruct the result to generate cases
    with assumptions that the [re] does or does not match the empty
    string.

    Hint: You can save quite a bit of work by using lemmas proved
    above. In particular, to prove many cases of the induction, you
    can rewrite a [Prop] over a complicated regex (e.g., [s =~ Union
    re0 re1]) to a Boolean combination of [Prop]'s over simple
    regex's (e.g., [s =~ re0 \/ s =~ re1]) using lemmas given above
    that are logical equivalences. You can then reason about these
    [Prop]'s naturally using [intro] and [destruct]. *)

(** [] *)

(** We'll define the regex matcher using [derive]. However, the only
    property of [derive] that you'll need to use in all proofs of
    properties of the matcher is [derive_corr]. *)

(** A function [m] matches regexes if, given string [s] and regex [re],
    it evaluates to a value that reflects whether [s] is matched by
    [re]. I.e., [m] holds the following property: *)
Definition matches_regex m : Prop :=
    forall (s : string) re, reflect (s =~ re) (m s re).

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, standard, optional (regex_match)

    Complete the definition of [regex_match] so that it matches
    regexes. *)
Fixpoint regex_match (s : string) (re : reg_exp ascii) : bool
    (* REPLACE THIS LINE WITH ":= _your_definition_ ." *). Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard, optional (regex_refl)

    Finally, prove that [regex_match] in fact matches regexes.

    Hint: if your definition of [regex_match] applies [match_eps] to
    regex [re], then a natural proof applies [match_eps_refl] to [re]
    and destructs the result to generate cases in which you may assume
    that [re] does or does not match the empty string.

    Hint: if your definition of [regex_match] applies [derive] to
    character [x] and regex [re], then a natural proof applies
    [derive_corr] to [x] and [re] to prove that [x :: s =~ re] given
    [s =~ derive x re], and vice versa. *)
